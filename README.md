## Description

### Task 1: Swap Case Function

##### Description:
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox', the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

### Task 2: Generate Array Function

##### Description:

Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7]. Also, -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

### Task 3: Prime Numbers Function

##### Description:

Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. The implementation ensures efficient identification of prime numbers and returns them in the same order as they appear in the input array. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the output should be [2, 3, 5, 7]

### Conclusion

Each function has been implemented efficiently to accomplish its specific task accurately.
